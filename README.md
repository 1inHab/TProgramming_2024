1. Repository Quality (Source Code, Branches, Commits, READMEs, etc.)
1. Issues/Board/Milestones (how much issues/milesones were closed, tickets management quality, etc.)
1. Merge Requests (overall MRs qualry, all MRs must be reviewed and approved, etc.)

As output of your learning on Bootcamp you should have 3 branches:
1. codewars 
1. rpgsaga
1. onlineshop (should be default branch)
