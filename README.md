# How to Work with this Project

This project is your Portfolio: your future interviewer will take a look at that repo and pay attention to:
1. Repository Quality (Source Code, Branches, Commits, READMEs, etc.)
1. Issues/Board/Milestones (how many issues/milesones were closed, tickets management quality, etc.)
1. Merge Requests (overall MRs qualry, all MRs must be reviewed and approved, etc.)

If you have any blockers or questions please feel free to ping both Bootcamp LT or PT Mentor (depends on what task you are currently doing).

As output of your learning on Bootcamp you should have 3 branches:
1. codewars 
1. rpgsaga
1. onlineshop (should be default branch)

## Good Luck!
